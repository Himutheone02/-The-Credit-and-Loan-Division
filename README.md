# Bank Financial Decision-Making Program

## Description
A Python-based console application to assist banks in evaluating financial decisions. The program includes a credit card application process, a monthly payment calculator for loans, and an IRA maturity calculator, offering real-time and accurate financial calculations.

## Motivation
This project was driven by the need for a streamlined approach to financial decision-making for banks and customers. It simplifies complex calculations and decision-making processes, reducing manual errors and enhancing productivity.

## Why Build This Project?
The project was designed to automate critical financial tasks, such as loan repayment planning, credit card approvals, and IRA maturity projections, while providing an easy-to-use interface for users.

## Problem Solved
The program eliminates the need for manual calculations in credit card approvals, loan payments, and IRA investments. It ensures accuracy, saves time, and provides a reliable platform for financial planning.

## What I Learned
- Designing modular programs using functions.
- Handling user inputs and error validation effectively.
- Implementing mathematical calculations for finance-based operations.
- Applying conditionals and loops in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Credit Card Application**: Evaluates eligibility based on account balance and assigns card type (Platinum, Gold, Silver).
- **Loan Payment Calculator**: Computes monthly payments for loans based on principal, interest rate, and tenure.
